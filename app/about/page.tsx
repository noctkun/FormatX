                <p>
                    Got an image that’s too big, too small, or just plain wrong? No problem. Resize, crop, rotate, or switch formats faster than you can say “PNG to JPEG.” Because why should your files have the final word?

                <p>
                    Audio files acting up? Convert between formats like MP3, WAV, or AAC, trim out the awkward silences, or stitch tracks together like a pro. It’s like having a DJ in your pocket (without the sunglasses).
